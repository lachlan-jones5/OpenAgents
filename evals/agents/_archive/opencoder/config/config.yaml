# Opencoder Agent Test Configuration
# 
# NOTE: This is the LEGACY test structure for backward compatibility.
# New tests should use the category-based structure: evals/agents/core/opencoder/
# 
# The agent path "opencoder" is automatically resolved to "core/opencoder"
# for backward compatibility.
